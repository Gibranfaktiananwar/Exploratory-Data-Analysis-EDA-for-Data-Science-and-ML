Simply put, the goal of regression is to predict a certain value for a numerical outcome variable, such as a student's test score or a worker's income, based on various observable factors, called features.

Regression works with data sets that aim to predict a numerical estimate of diabetes progression one year after the initial data. In other words, for each patient (observation), the goal is to predict a numerical score that indicates the development of diabetes one year after their blood pressure, body mass index, and blood sugar levels are recorded.
